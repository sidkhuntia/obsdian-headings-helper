# Heading Helper Plugin for Obsidian

A powerful Obsidian plugin that provides intelligent heading management with hierarchy checking, visual gutter badges, and smart cycling operations.

## üåü Features

### üìä Visual Gutter Badges
- **Subtle indicators** showing heading levels (H1-H6) in the editor gutter
- **Click to change** - Direct heading level selection via dropdown menu
- **Customizable styling** - Adjust colors and appearance
- **Only for headings** - Badges appear only for actual headings, keeping the interface clean

### üîÑ Smart Heading Operations
- **Keyboard shortcuts** for quick heading level changes
- **Heading-only operations** - Only existing headings can be cycled/promoted/demoted
- **Paragraph preservation** - Regular paragraphs are never affected by cycling operations
- **H6 special handling** - Configurable behavior for H6 demotion

### üõ°Ô∏è Hierarchy Protection
- **Check heading hierarchy**: Enable smart warnings (via Notices) for specific cases:
  - **H1 Uniqueness**: Prevents promoting any heading to H1 if an H1 already exists elsewhere.
  - **Selected H1/H2**: Warns if the selected text contains both H1 and H2 when promoting.
  - **H5‚ÜíH6 Flow Break**: Warns when demoting H5 to H6 if "Wrap after H6" is disabled and both H5 & H6 exist globally.
  - **H5/H6 to Paragraph Reminder**: If "Wrap after H6" is ON and H5/H6 exist globally, reminds that repeated demotion leads to Paragraphs.
  - **H6 Demotion Block**: Prevents H6 becoming Paragraph if "Wrap after H6" is disabled.
  - **Paragraph Cascade**: Warns if demoting H1-H5 to Paragraph would orphan lower-level headings.
  - **Debounced Notices**: Prevents spamming notices for identical warnings on the same line quickly.
- **Allow hierarchy override**: If a warning for a *blocking* issue (H1 uniqueness, H6 demotion block, H5‚ÜíH6 flow break, Paragraph cascade) is shown, this setting allows the operation to proceed. If off, these operations are blocked. General warnings always allow the operation after notice.

### Visual Customization
- **Show gutter badges**: Toggle badge visibility
- **Badge colors**: Customize background and text colors
- **Subtle design**: Low-opacity badges that brighten on hover

## üéØ How It Works

### Heading Operations Logic

**Promotion (Moving Up)**:
- H6 ‚Üí H5 ‚Üí H4 ‚Üí H3 ‚Üí H2 ‚Üí H1
- H1 stays H1 (no wrapping to paragraph)
- Only works on existing headings

**Demotion (Moving Down)**:
- H1 ‚Üí H2 ‚Üí H3 ‚Üí H4 ‚Üí H5 ‚Üí H6
- H6 behavior depends on "Wrap after H6" setting:
  - `On`: H6 ‚Üí Paragraph
  - `Off`: H6 stays H6

**Paragraphs**:
- Never affected by cycling operations
- Maintained as-is to preserve document structure

### Hierarchy Checking Examples

**Smart Warning Scenarios & Behavior (All warnings are Notices):**

1.  **Critical: H1 Uniqueness Violation**
    *   **Rule**: Promoting any heading to H1 when an H1 already exists elsewhere.
    *   **Behavior**: Shows Notice. Operation **blocked** unless "Allow hierarchy override" is ON.
    *   **Message**: `Cannot promote to H1: An H1 already exists. Documents should have only one top-level H1.`

2.  **General: Promotion within H1/H2 Context in Selection**
    *   **Rule**: Promoting any heading when the *current text selection* contains both H1 and H2 headings.
    *   **Behavior**: Shows Notice. Operation **proceeds** (this is a general advisory).
    *   **Message**: `Warning: The current selection contains both H1 and H2 headings. Promoting headings within this selection might affect overall document structure. Please review.`

3.  **Blocking: H5‚ÜíH6 Demotion into Dead-End**
    *   **Rule**: Demoting an H5 to H6, if "Wrap after H6" is OFF, and both H5 & H6 levels exist globally.
    *   **Behavior**: Shows Notice. Operation **blocked** unless "Allow hierarchy override" is ON.
    *   **Message**: `Demoting H5 to H6: "Wrap after H6" is disabled, and both H5 and H6 levels exist globally. This can create a dead-end. Consider enabling "Wrap after H6".`

4.  **General: H5/H6 Demotion Reminder with Wrap ON**
    *   **Rule**: Demoting an H5 or H6, if "Wrap after H6" is ON, and both H5 & H6 levels exist globally.
    *   **Behavior**: Shows Notice. Operation **proceeds** (this is a reminder).
    *   **Message**: `Reminder: "Wrap after H6" is enabled. Repeatedly demoting H5/H6 will eventually convert them to Paragraphs. The document contains both H5 and H6 levels.`

5.  **Blocking: H6 to Paragraph Demotion with Wrap OFF**
    *   **Rule**: Attempting to demote H6 to Paragraph when "Wrap after H6" is OFF.
    *   **Behavior**: Shows Notice. Operation **blocked** unless "Allow hierarchy override" is ON. (The heading remains H6).
    *   **Message**: `Cannot demote H6 to Paragraph: "Wrap after H6" is disabled. Enable this setting to allow conversion to Paragraph.`

6.  **Blocking: Paragraph Cascade (Orphaning Headings)**
    *   **Rule**: Demoting H1-H5 to Paragraph (with "Wrap after H6" ON) if doing so would leave lower-level headings (H2-H6) without a proper parent in the sequence.
    *   **Behavior**: Shows Notice. Operation **blocked** unless "Allow hierarchy override" is ON.
    *   **Message**: `Converting [CurrentLevel] to Paragraph might orphan existing lower-level headings (e.g., [NextLevel]). Review structure.`

**Operation Handling**:
- **Notices Only**: All warnings are non-intrusive Obsidian Notices.
- **Override Control**: The "Allow hierarchy override" setting determines if *blocking* issues prevent the operation or allow it after the notice.
- **Debounced Notices**: Repeated identical warnings for the same line and operation are suppressed for 1.5 seconds to avoid clutter.

## ‚å®Ô∏è Default Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Ctrl/‚åò + Shift + H** - Cycle heading level
- **Ctrl/‚åò + Shift + ‚Üë** - Promote heading (decrease level)
- **Ctrl/‚åò + Shift + ‚Üì** - Demote heading (increase level)

*All shortcuts can be customized in Obsidian's Hotkeys settings*

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Install** the plugin from Obsidian's Community Plugins
2. **Enable** in Settings ‚Üí Community Plugins
3. **Configure** in Settings ‚Üí Heading Helper
4. **Use** keyboard shortcuts or click gutter badges to manage headings

## üí° Best Practices

### Document Structure
- Start with H1 for main topics
- Use H2 for major sections under H1
- Use H3-H6 for nested subsections
- Let the plugin warn you about hierarchy breaks

### Settings Recommendations
- **Enable hierarchy checking** for structured documents
- **Allow override** if you need flexibility
- **Enable H6 wrap** for natural document flow
- **Show gutter badges** for visual feedback

### Workflow Tips
- Use **Ctrl/‚åò + Shift + ‚Üë/‚Üì** for precise level adjustments
- Use **Ctrl/‚åò + Shift + H** for quick cycling
- **Click badges** when you need to jump multiple levels
- **Pay attention to warnings** - they help maintain document quality

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### Custom Styling
The plugin respects Obsidian's theme variables and can be further customized with CSS snippets:

```css
.heading-helper-badge {
    /* Custom badge styling */
    font-family: monospace;
    border: 1px solid var(--text-accent);
}

.heading-helper-menu {
    /* Custom menu styling */
    box-shadow: 0 4px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
}
```

### Integration with Other Plugins
The plugin provides a public API for integration:
- `getHeadingLevel(editor, lineNumber)`
- `setHeadingLevel(editor, targetLevel, lineNumber)`
- `cycleHeading(editor, direction)`
